## About

"Perspectives on El Salvador" is an aspirational digital collection and project portfolio for Dr. Jessica Pauzsek's Archives in Action class. "Perspectives" attempts to create a new locus of Salvadoran and Salvadoran-American archival perspectives that mix being mediated and not mediated by outside forces -- namely, the U.S. government, as many Salvadoran objects are most easily accessible on U.S. government sites. This digital collection, which I hope to add to in the future, contains a variety of objects: multiple photography collections, poems by a radical Salvadoran poet, and a research essay closely analyzing a Salvadoran house decoration. These objects originate from the 1960s to the present day, as the 1960s marked a time of political turmoil and scapegoatism towards leftist or Marxist beliefs, and such political radicalism characterize El Salvador's modern government today.

This collection also serves to unify my final projects for all three of my first semester graduate school classes. The tab marked "American Studies Project" contains a variety of webpages that form a formal research paper and Prownian analysis of a Salvadoran decoration, which I am treating as a cultural artifact. The tab marked "Intro to Digital Humanities" contains six different digital editions of translated poems by Salvadoran poet Roque Dalton. Eahc poem is marked up via TEI to note and analyze instances of Marxist rhetoric, defined as such by secondary scholarship that isolates Marx's rhetorical strategies. Each poem is also presented in English and Spanish as PDFs.
