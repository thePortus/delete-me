                <note type="editorial">I have chosen my definition and categorization of “marxist rhetoric” based on James Martin's 2022 article “Marx's Rhetoric,”
                    featured in the Goldsmiths Research online repository. I focus on his detailed explanation of the rhetoric of criticism, dynamics of class
                    politics, and rhetoric of critical political economy. I often choose to mark phrases that read as “call to actions,” as Martin claims that 
                    Marx sought to urge the working class to become forces of social and political change. I also zone in on themes of martyrdom, that seem to 
                    align themselves with critiquing the governing classes while lauding the sacrifices of the lower (or change-making) classes.</note>

             <note xml:id="no1">The "men" that Dalton speak about seem to exist unapologetically, and rage on regardless of
             the circumstances. Despair may be an emotional symbol for oppressive powers, and the men are willing to urgently 
             "shake their fists" at it.</note>
            <note xml:id="no2">This is very similar sentiment to the previous line, but utilized more overt notions of justice
            vis-a-vis the notion of "avenging crimes."</note>
            <note xml:id="no3">Scythes are associated with reaping and death; quite literally the cutting down of lives en masse
            in the same way as sheaves of wheat. The vicious scythe may be another symbol of governmental oppression.</note>
