A New Nationalism: Creating Culture with Salvadoran Knick Knacks
--
  “What’s little understood is that the mass exodus to the United States earlier this year [2014] was actually 30 years in the making, fueled by American foreign policy decisions in the early 1980s and an act of Congress in the mid 1990s.”

<p>  Hanging in my Brighton apartment kitchen is a clunky-looking wooden decoration, gifted to my husband by his father as a house-warming present. I remember eyeing it when I first visited his Harvard dormitory sophomore year of college, as it stood out starkly against the pop culture posters and hastily painted walls of the century-old Cambridge building. The piece was the only “Salvadoran” identifier in the room – it contained strung prints of a defunct Salvadoran form of currency, and exhibited colorful graphics and phrases boasting of El Salvador’s “magical” qualities. The slightly fuzzy graphics on the header appeared heavily tropical – with parrots, toucans, and yucca planta peppering the glossy, fake-wooden grain. The bottom eight pieces were all rectangular and each printed a Salvadoran colón, starting from the lowest value (one colón) to the highest one (200 colónes).</p> 
     
<p>  My father-in-law – a Salvadoran immigrant himself – purchased this decoration in San Miguelito market in San Salvador. The market is one of many shopping hubs in El – where vendors sell food, clothing, and handmade crafts and artisanal items. It is important to note that many artisanal items – mostly art pieces and housewares made out of clay or wood and then painted – are sold right alongside cheaper-looking, mass-printed items. These mass-made objects are characterized by choppy (not well-integrated) graphic design, fuzzy or poor-quality printed images, and are usually on some factory-made base, like a plain t-shirt, plain white mug, etc. The existence of two types of commodities – hand-made versus machine-made – elicits a complex narrative about cultural production that can be further explained by looking at colonial hierarchies.</p>

<p>  Handmade crafts and artisanal items have been historically central to Salvadoran culture and even social survival, especially during the height of Spanish colonialism. Following the early sixteenth-century Spanish invasion of Central America, what is now present-day El Salvador was considered on the “periphery,” meaning, it was a nation “outside of the modern and developed center,” the center being colonial Spain (Osegueda and Ricardo 1). Furthermore, a racial hierarchy formed that influenced social mobility and economic standing for different “classes” of people within a nation with minimized colonial potential. This ethnic division where “Spaniards were above all others, followed by “Indios,” and, finally, enslaved Africans,” reflected this socioeconomic hierarchy (Osegueda and Ricardo 2). The “Indios” (indigenous people) who were towards the bottom of the hierarchy thus “had to engage in craft activities or share their subsistence tasks” (Osegueda and Ricardo 2). In other words, craft was central to a peasant subsistence economy, allowing these “handicrafts…[to function] as badges of identities…[for] villages” (Pi-Sunyer). Crafting and low-level artisanal production have historically characterized the indigenous, rural side of the Salvadoran economy, and serve as a pillar of Salvadoran character and intrigue, as well as a threatened point of production. As technology evolved, and as “the distinction between the world of the village producer and trader and the world of the national economy” widened, crafting and artisanal culture – and the appeal of the carefully hand-made item – battled alongside more “cheap machine-made articles” (Pi-Sunyer). Craft culture has only come back as people grew tired of mass-produced items, and as El Salvador began initiatives to put rural areas (and their unique craft cultures) back on the map for tourists.</p>  
  
<p>  This is especially evident through the kinds of tourist activities that the Salvadoran Ministry of Tourism tends to market. El Salvador tourism sites boast about the six cities of the “El Salvador Arts and Crafts Route,” taking you through the towns of Ilobasco, San Ignacio, La Palma, Suchitoto, Citala, and San Sebastian (Galdamez). I have visited the town of Ilobasco, which is lined with open buildings filled with these crafts. They hold both a mixture of the hand-made and the machine-made. It is fascinating to note that despite the historical significance of hand-made items, from a distance and to the untrained eye, they appear no different from machine-made items. </p>

<p>  These items not only boast of Salvadoran culture through mass evidence of this form of crafting as subsistence but also in the symbols and rhetoric painted or printed on these objects. It seems that those artisans – whether they’re making items by hand or by machine – assume that making explicit connections to El Salvador will be more attractive to tourists wanting to take home a cultural tchotchke. However, there might also be a level of nationalism conveyed on these items, by Salvadoran artisans, for other Salvadorans or Salvadoran immigrants who are finally able to come back home to visit. This nationalism, I assert, specifically peaked after the Salvadoran Civil War, the election of current-day President Bukele, and a slew of U.S. policies that affected the Salvadoran economy and welfare of its government and citizens. My hanging colón artifact, while on the surface just a “cultural tchotchke,” actually serves as a window into El Salvador’s complex political, economic, social, and cultural history, including the tensions between colonial and indigenous cultures, the ebbs and flows of tourism and immigration, and a recently renewed sense of Salvadoran nationalism. </p>
