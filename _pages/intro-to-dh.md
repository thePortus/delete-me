The Edition
--
Each poem I have selected from Roque Dalton's "The Injured Party's Turn" is shown in Spanish (the original version) and English (the translated version). I have chose six poems in accordance to how they explicitly or implictly betray Roque Dalton's political leanings. I am interested in how his exile from his home country affected his mental state: how it embittered him, how it inflated his paranoia, and how it radicalized him even more towards the left. My mark-up attempts to analyze this "marxist rhetoric," as I have labelled it.

A Note on Methodology
--
I have chosen my definition and categorization of “marxist rhetoric” based on James Martin's 2022 article “Marx's Rhetoric,” featured in the Goldsmiths Research online repository. I focus on his detailed explanation of the rhetoric of criticism, dynamics of class politics, and rhetoric of critical political economy. I often choose to mark phrases that read as “call to actions,” as Martin claims that Marx sought to urge the working class to become forces of social and political change. I also zone in on themes of martyrdom, that seem to align themselves with critiquing the governing classes while lauding the sacrifices of the lower (or change-making) classes.
