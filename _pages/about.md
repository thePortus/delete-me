About "Perspectives of El Salvador"
--

  Throughout my searching for archives that held objects pertaining to the Salvadoran Civil War, Salvadoran civilian life, and Salvadoran-American cultural heritage, I confronted a frusterating reality. I could only find artifacts on subjects explicitly linked to U.S. policy, from the perspective of U.S. policymakers, journalists, and declassified documents. 

  Despite these perspectives being useful, especially in elucidating how the U.S. has impacted El Salvador politically, it gave no agency to the people of El Salvador themselves -- the people actually affected by events being described from the outside. 

  Here, I'm seeking to provide a haven for a mixed population of objects -- both for and by Salvadorans, and for Salvadorans, by Americans -- to give agency to Salvadoran subjects and figures. I am trying to offer a place where Salvadoran stories can be conveyed with less mediation. My motivation comes from the fact that I myself care about these stories and am personally involved with them, as my family has authorized me to observe their lives, struggles, hopes, fears, and dreams. 

  Through the objects offered, some actively interpreted by me with scholarly intent, I hope to begin to encourage the filling of archival gaps, while still respecting and upholding the perserved objects that are already available.
