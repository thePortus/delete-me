Poema Lejano de Amor Project 
---

Click here to see the [Poema Lejano de Amor Project](http://marioquiroz.com/poema-lejano-de-amor-project.html), a photograph series by Salvadoran-American photographer Mario Quiroz. “Poema Lejano de Amor” translates to the “Far Away Love Poem,” and is a reference to 20th century Salvadoran poet Roque Dalton’s most famous poem, “Poema de Amor.” Quiroz takes a series of black-and-white photographs of Salvadoran-Americans living in Boston, Massachusetts in order to explore the theme of conveying national and cultural identity and pride even while being far away from your country of birth. Each photograph is meant to correspond with a line in Dalton’s original poem in Spanish, though in the audio presentation, Quiroz recites the poem in English.

El Salvador: State of Exemption
--

Click here to see the [El Salvador: State of Exemption photo series](https://www.robertnickelsberg.com/elsal-introduction), created by Times Magazine photographer Robert Nickelsberg, which documents the violent realities of El Salvador civilians and guerilla fighters during the Salvadoran Civil War. Nickelsberg entered El Salvador in 1981 with the intention to objectively capture the activities of both leftist FMLN revolutionaries, who were responsible for inciting the war, but also to capture the U.S.-backed counterinsurgency and Salvadoran government and military response. Nickelsberg remained in El Salvador during the war until 1984. In doing so Nickelsberg observed brutality – affecting daily civilian life – on both sides and confirmed his own country’s financial and militaristic involvement in it.

The Dark Triangle
--

Click here to see [The Dark Triangle photo series](https://fred-ramos.com/the-dark-triangle), created by Mexico-based Salvadoran photographer Fred Ramos, documenting Central-American migration factors and realities. Ramos photographs the perilous journey that Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Nicaraguans make every year enmasse to escape political and religious persecution, and even dangerous climate factors. He does so to humanize migrants in some of the most traumatizing moments of their life, when they are so often criminalized in the places they are fleeing to. This collection was published in 2018, during the midst of the first Trump administration and all the harsh immigration policies being enforced during that time.

Unaccompanied
--

Click here to listen to Salvadoran-American poet and author Jaview Zamora reading from his [poetry collection "Unaccompanied"](https://www.loc.gov/item/2019408291/) which tells of his home in El Salvador, his crossing into the U.S., ensuing trauma, aftermath, and healing. This clip is taken from the Library of Congress Archives as part of the Hispanic Literature on Tape Collection and Palabra Archive, and was recorded in 2017, right after the release of “Unaccompanied.” The collection explores his journey at the age of nine being accompanied by a coyote to eventually meet his parents in the American Southwest. The poems he reads from speak of themes of longing, fear, anger, bitterness, and nostalgia. The collection came out once he had been in the U.S. almost two decades, eliciting much time for reflection. His memoir, “Solito,” came out in 2022, and expands upon some of the themes in his poetry.

Public Library Photo Collection](https://tessa2.lapl.org/digital/collection/photos/search/searchterm/Salvadoran%20Americans--California--Los%20Angeles./field/subjec/mode/exact/conn/and) that houses pictures of Salvadoran-American citizens living in Los Angeles in the late twentieth century, held at the TESSA Digital Collections of the Los Angeles Public Library. These images are part of the Shades of L.A. collection, which serve to portray and memorialize the historical and cultural diversity of families living in Los Angeles. These pictures were crowdsourced from various personal and non-profit organizations, and depict daily life in the context of family albums, social organizations, work, personal and holiday celebrations, and migration and immigration activities. The four images presented are all Salvadoran portraits or family photos, which look as if they date generally back to the middle or middle-end of the twentieth century.
