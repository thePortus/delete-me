  "Perspectives on El Salvador" is an aspirational digital collection and project portfolio for Dr. Jessica Pauszek's Archives in Action class. "Perspectives" attempts to create a new locus of Salvadoran and Salvadoran-American archival perspectives that mix being mediated and not mediated by outside forces -- namely, the U.S. government, as many Salvadoran objects are most easily accessible on U.S. government sites. This digital collection, which I hope to add to in the future, contains a variety of objects: multiple photography collections, poems by a radical Salvadoran poet, and a research essay closely analyzing a Salvadoran house decoration. These objects originate from the 1960s to the present day, as the 1960s marked a time of political turmoil and scapegoatism towards leftist or Marxist beliefs, and such political radicalism characterizes El Salvador's modern government today.

  This collection also serves to unify my final projects for all three of my first semester graduate school classes. The tab marked "American Studies Project" contains a variety of webpages that form a formal research paper and Prownian analysis of a Salvadoran decoration, which I am treating as a cultural artifact. The tab marked "Intro to Digital Humanities" contains six different digital editions of translated poems by Salvadoran poet Roque Dalton. Each poem is marked up via TEI to note and analyze instances of Marxist rhetoric, defined as such by secondary scholarship that isolates Marx's rhetorical strategies. Each poem is also presented in English and Spanish as PDFs.

  To my professors, please explore your section (and any others) as much as you'd like. Here is a guide for any professor that ends up on the home page:

  <b>Dr. Pauszek:</b> Everything and anything is fine to focus on! The meat of my digital collection (and thick descriptions), however, are in the [Salvadoran Digital Resources](salvadoran-digital-resources) and [Salvadoran Archives](salvadoran-archives) pages.

 <b> Dr. Picone:</b> I would suggest starting on the [Intro to Digital Humanities](intro-to-dh) page, which has an introduction and methods section to preface my TEI. Each poem in the dropdown submenu has its own TEI digital edition and bilingual PDFs to accompany them.

<b>  Dr. Klein:</b> The [American Studies Project](american-studies) tab houses my research paper. I would start at the American Studies Project main tab itself, which includes my paper introduction. If you don't want to click on submenus to go to the next paper section (organized by subheading), simply click "next page" on the bottom of each page in the American Studies tab group.
